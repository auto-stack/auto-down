// CodeEditorController (plan 023 P1T4) — the headless logic behind
// CodeEditorBlock.vue (BlockHost pattern: logic here, DOM wiring in the SFC).
//
// Commit protocol: while the textarea is focused it owns its text; on blur
// the WHOLE code text is written back as one undo step (applyTree over
// replaceNode + withInlines). Whole-text commit because code is multi-line —
// a character diff op would thread "\n" through the text-op kernel, which
// the host protocol only ever sees for single-line leaf blocks.
