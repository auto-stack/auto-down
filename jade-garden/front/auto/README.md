# Jade Garden — Auto sources

Vue components of `jade-garden/front` are being rewritten in the Auto
language (plan 011). This directory is the embedded Auto project (same
pattern as `autodown/packages/editor/src/auto`).

## Layout

- `pac.at` — Auto project manifest (`scene: "ui"`, `render: "vue"`)
- `src/front/*.at` — widget sources (one component per file)
- `src/front/app.at` — placeholder root widget (never deployed; required so
  real widgets are emitted as standalone `components/<Name>.vue`)
- `src/front/utils/*_ext.ts` — handwritten TS extensions, only for what the
  DSL genuinely cannot express (npm libs, try/catch, regex literals)
- `stubs/` — gen-project stubs for dual-resolution shims (see editor's
  src/auto/README.md for the mechanism)
- `gen/` — generated Vue project (gitignored)

## Regenerate

```sh
cd jade-garden/front/auto
D:/autostack/auto-lang/target/debug/auto.exe build -d .
# then copy + sed-rewrite generated SFCs into front/src/ (per-component,
# see editor package README for the @/ext -> relative import rewrite)
```

**Caveat:** `auto build` does NOT fail on widget parse errors — it logs
`Warning: Failed to compile <path>` and leaves the stale SFC in place.
Always check the output for that warning after editing a widget.

Do NOT run `auto run` / `auto build` from the jade-garden root: the legacy
AutoUI project files were archived to `jade-garden/legacy-autoui/`
(plan 011 Phase 5.0a) precisely because the old workflow overwrote
`front/src/App.vue` with a placeholder.
